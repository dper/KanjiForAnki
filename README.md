KanjiForAnki
============

This program takes a list of kanji and generates Anki flash cards for each them.

Objective
=========

This project is a script that takes a list of kanji as input and outputs a file that can be imported into Anki and used to study the given kanji.

Kanji are Japanese characters.  There are several thousand in existence.  Of those, roughly 2,000 are important for daily life in Japan.  English speakers learning Japanese often use SRS flash card systems to study.  One such program is Anki (<http://ankisrs.net/>).  People have created many different Anki decks for studying, but there are three drawbacks commonly encountered: the information is unreliable, the information is not freely licensed, or the information is not in the format you want.

Using this script, or rather, by modifying this script, you can customize flash card generation and produce cards you feel are particularly efficient for your studying needs.  The default settings are ones the author finds useful, so presumably you can use the script as-is, should you so desire.

The kanji lists themselves are published by the Ministry of Education (MEXT) in Japan.  Other websites copy and paste the data from official MEXT documents.
